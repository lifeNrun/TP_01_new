### API
1. The collection on mongodb is blogcontents and the api endpoint is http://bowerman-meshapi-goat.herokuapp.com/blogContents?query={} and the schema is blogContents this needs to be fixed,  I am not sure how the api is pointing to the mongodb collection called blogcontents but I renamed blogContents to xblogContents to prove it was the right one.
