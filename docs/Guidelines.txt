This document provides the guidelines while working on this application.

1. As much as possible user AngularJS and not jQuery. This is an 
AngularJS application and chances are that what you want to achieve 
using jQuery can be done using AngularJS too.

2. While writing code, use 2 or 4 space indents, not more. For files 
that you create, go with 4 space indentations. Else, go with the 
indentation that is already present in the file.

3. Comment your code as much as possible. Remember that your 
application could be enhanced later by some other developer.

4. Follow the directory structure of the application. Do not place 
files and folders in any arbitrary folder - understand the application structure and 
place them accordingly. The directory structure has been borrowed from the AngularJS - 
Express seed repository:
https://github.com/btford/angular-express-seed#directory-layout

5. Make as little use of custom CSS as possible. This application has been built using
Twitter Bootstrap CSS and thus you are expected to take full advantage of the existing
bootstrap classes before defining your own.

6. No inline styling. No inline javascript.
